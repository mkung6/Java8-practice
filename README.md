A repository for practicing the newer features in Java 8.

Currently focusing on lambda expressions and streams.

## Goal:

At Seattle University, we mainly used plain Java from 1.6. Because academic lessons in Java are rather antiquated, I wanted to learn how to use a more modern and practical Java.

Java 8 looks easier to write, and therefore possibly more suited when tackling coding challenges.

### Future goals:

1. Learn Java frameworks and testing in Java.
